## Introduction

Intelligence, personality, and many other psychological constructs are often measured using scales. This type of data is normally collected using questionnaires (also called surveys). Answers to the questions are given numerical values, most commonly using a Likert scale. Likert scales associate numbers with a set of answers which express some degree of agreement each question e.g. `0=Not at all, 1=A little, 2=Somewhat, 3=A lot, 4=Extremely`. A formula is applied to the scores for some or all of the questions to calculate an overall score for the scale. The formula often just consists of adding up the individual scores (more on this below).

A psychometric scale is a scale which has undergone some degree of testing to ensure that it is valid and reliable measure of the underlying construct. For example, a valid intelligence scale would truely measure intelligence, rather than some other constructy (e.g. memory). A reliable scale gives consistent results, i.e. a person who completed the scale at different times would produce similar scores, as would two people who are similar in terms of the construct measured by the scale. Most published scales have been tested to ensure they are valid and reliable, so it's advisable to use an existing scale if one exists, before creating your own.

Surveys can be created using [JISC](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/), [Gorilla Survey](https://gorilla.sc/), [OpenSesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/), [The Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/experiments/), [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) and many other software packages. Most software will allow you to save your data as a CSV file. The precise structure of the data varies between packages, so you are likely to have to start by [preprocessing](preproc.html) your data.

In this worksheet, we'll cover some common techniques which you are likely to use to preprocess psychometric scale data. These techniques should be useful regardless of the software you used to administer your survey data, although they will need slight modifications depending on the way your raw data is organised.

<a name="start"></a>

## Getting started

To prepare for this worksheet:

1. Open the `rminr-data` project we used [previously](preproc.html#load).

1. If you don't see a folder named `going-further`, it means you created your project _before_ the data required for this worksheet was added to the `rminr-data` git repository. You can get the latest files by asking git to "`pull`" the repository. Select the `Git` tab, which is located in the row of tabs which includes the `Environment` tab. Click the `Pull` button with a downward pointing arrow. A window will open showing the files which have been pulled from the repository. Close the `Git pull` window.

1. Open the `Files` tab. The `going-further` folder should contain the files `dass21.csv` and `sses.sav`.

1. Create a script named `scales.R` in the `rminr-data` folder (the folder above `going-further`). Add the code to this script as you work through each section of the worksheet.

We start with some lines to clear the workspace and load `tidyverse`.

```{r init-load, message=FALSE}
rm(list = ls()) # clear the environment
library(tidyverse)
```

<a name="select"></a>

## Selecting data

Our first step will be to remove columns from the raw survey data which aren't needed for data analysis.  We'll demonstrate this using some real data from the Depression Anxiety Stress Scalesâ€”21 (DASS-21, Henry & Crawford, 2005), a 21-item scale for measuring depression, anxiety and stress.

```{r pre-process-dass}
dass21_raw <- read_csv("going-further/dass21.csv")
dass21_raw <- select(dass21_raw, partID, Age:DASS21)
```

**Explanation of command:**

1. We read the DASS-21 CSV file into the data frame `dass21_raw`.

1. We then `select()` just the columns in `dass21_raw` that we want to keep. The first column we `select()`, is the participant ID, which is stored in the `partID` column. Arguments to `select()` can also be consecutive ranges of columns in a data frame, consisting of the first and last column name (ordered from left to right), separated by a `:`. This avoids having to type out long lists of column names.  Here we use `Age:DASS21` to select all columns between `Age` and `DASS21`.

The table below shows the first few rows from `dass21_raw`. In this study, the data was recorded in "wide" format (one row for each participant). Notice that our data frame contains only the columns that we selected in the commands above. The DASS-21 scores are in columns `DASS1`-`DASS21`.

```{r dass21, echo=FALSE}
head(dass21_raw) %>% pander(split.table = Inf)
```

<a name="missing"></a>

## Handling missing data

If participants don't complete (or partially complete) a survey, you may want to exclude their data from your analyses. If we look at a section of the DASS-21 data, we can see that data is missing for some participants.

```{r missing, echo=FALSE}
slice(dass21_raw, 73:76) %>% pander(split.table = Inf)
```

Participants `108`, and `109` (rows 3 and 4) have numbers in all columns, indicating that their data is complete. However, participants `106` and `107` have cells containing the value `NA`, which means these cells in the CSV file were empty. For participant `106`, all cells are `NA` (perhaps they dropped out of the study), and for participant `107`, all of the DASS-21 cells are `NA` (perhaps they skipped this survey).

We can exclude any rows with missing data as follows:

```{r exclude-missing}
dass21 <- dass21_raw %>% drop_na()
```

**Explanation of command:**

* We pipe the raw data into the `drop_na()` function (part of the `tidyverse` package). This drops any rows with a column containing `NA`, which includes data for participants `106` and `107`.

```{r exclude, echo=FALSE}
slice(dass21, 68:72) %>% pander(split.table = Inf)
```

<a name="subscales"></a>

## Calculating subscale scores

Our next step is to calculate the scores for the constructs measured by our scale. Many scales consist of groups of questions which measure multiple, distinct constructs. The DASS-21 is an example of a scale with subscale scores for depression, anxiety and stress. These are calculated by adding together responses for specific items, which we can do using the `rowSums()` function:

```{r dass21-subscales}
dass21 <- mutate(dass21, depression = rowSums(dass21[4 + c(3,5,10,13,16,17,21)]))
dass21_total <- select(dass21, partID, Age, Gender, depression)
```

**Explanation of command:**

* We use `mutate()` to create a `depression` column which is the sum of items 3, 5, 10, 13, 16, 17 and 21. Item 1 of the DASS-21 data is in column 5 of `dass21`, so we add 4 to each item number to select the correct columns to add together. The command `dass21[4 + c(3,5,10,13,16,17,21)]` is an example of "vectorised addition". It adds `4` to each of the columns defined in the vector to the right of the `+`. For each row, the values in the resulting columns are added together using `rowSums()`. We assign the result back to `dass21`, thereby creating a `depression` column for each row.

## Exercise 1

Use similar commands to add scores for anxiety and stress to `dass21`. The anxiety subscale is the sum of questions 2,4,7,9,15,19 and 20. The stress subscale is the sum of questions 1,6,8,11,12,14 and 18. The first few rows of `dass21_total` should look like this:

```{r ex1, echo=FALSE}
dass21 <- mutate(dass21, anxiety = rowSums(dass21[4 + c(2,4,7,9,15,19,20)]))
dass21 <- mutate(dass21, stress = rowSums(dass21[4 + c(1,6,8,11,12,14,18)]))
dass21_total <- select(dass21, partID, Age, Gender, depression, anxiety, stress)
dass21_total %>% head(10) %>% pander()
```

<a name="tidy"></a>

## Tidying survey data

Some data benefits from a little more tidying than simply removing columns which aren't required. We'll demonstrate this more advanced preprocessing using a different dataset. This data came from from an experiment in which self-esteem was measured before and after participants completed one of two mental imagery conditions, or a control condition. The experiment used the State Self-Esteem Scale (SSES, Heatherton & Polivy, 1991), a 20-item scale used to measure short-lived (state) changes in self-esteem.

```{r, R.options = list(width = 100)}
sses <- read_csv('going-further/sses.csv')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sses %>% head(3) %>% pander(split.table = Inf)
```

The data will be easier to analyse if we rename the columns. It will also be useful to divide the data into two data frames, one for the pre-intervention SSES, the other for the post-intervention SSES. We can do all of this in a single pipeline:

```{r preprocess-sses-pre}
sses_pre_raw  <- select(sses, 1, 5:25) %>%
  set_names(~ str_to_lower(.) %>% str_replace_all("pre_sse_", "q")) %>%
  mutate(subj = factor(partid), condition = factor(condition), time = factor('pre')) %>%
  select(subj, condition, time, q1:q20)
```

**Explanation of pipeline commands:**

1. `sses_pre_raw  <- select(sses, 1, 5:25)` - We save the output of the pipeline in `sses_pre_raw`. First, we `select()` column 1, and columns 5:25 from `sses`. Column 1 is the participant id, columns 5:24 are the SSES scores, and column 25 is the participant's condition.

1. `set_names(~ str_to_lower(.) %>% str_replace_all("pre_sse_", "q"))` - Next, we use the function `set_names()` to rename our columns. The `~` is a way of telling `set_names()` to apply a function to each column name. The remainder of the command is a "sub-pipeline" which tidies up the column name. The command `str_to_lower(.)` converts a string (the `.` means the current column name) to lower case. This lower case name is piped to `str_replace_all("pre_sse_", "q"))` which replaces any string with the prefix `pre_sse_` with `q`. All our columns are now lowercase, and the SSES questions are named `q1:q20`.

1. `mutate(subj = factor(partid), condition = factor(condition), time = factor('pre'))` - Next, we use `mutate` to add and modify some columns. The argument `subj = factor(partid)` creates a new column named `subj` (which is a bit clearer than `partid`) by copying the `partid` column and making it a factor. The argument `condition = factor(condition)` makes the `condition` column a factor. The argument `time = factor('pre')` creates a new factor called `time` and sets all values to `pre`.

1. `select(subj, condition, time, q1:q20)` - Finally, we use `select()` to put the columns into a convenient order for viewing.

We now have our pre-intervention SSES data in a data frame with clearer column headings:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sses_pre_raw %>% head(3) %>% pander(split.table = Inf)
```

<a name="ex2"></a>

## Exercise 2

Write a similar pipeline to create a data frame named `sses_post_raw` containing the post-intervention SSES data. The post-intervention SSES data are in columns `26:45`, these columns have the prefix `post_sse_` rather than `pre_sse_`. Set the value in the `time` factor to `post`. The first few rows of `sses_post_raw` should look like this:

```{r ex2, echo=FALSE}
sses_post_raw <- select(sses, 1, 25:45) %>%
  set_names(~ str_to_lower(.) %>% str_replace_all("post_sse_", "q")) %>%
  mutate(subj = factor(partid), condition = factor(condition), time = factor('post')) %>%
  select(subj, condition, time, q1:q20)
sses_post_raw %>% head(3) %>% pander(split.table = Inf)
```

<a name="reverse"></a>

## Reverse scoring survey items

The SSES questions are scored from `0 (Not at all)` to `4 (Extremely)`. Question 1 reads `I feel confident about my abilities`, so a higher score indicates higher self-esteem. However, a number of questions on the SSES are 'reverse scored'. For example, question 2 reads `I am worried about whether I am regarded as a success or failure`, so in this case a higher score indicates lower self-esteem. Surveys often use reverse scored questions to encourage participants to pay attention to the wording of each question. Before calculating a total SSES score, we need to reverse the reverse scored items, so that a higher number means higher self-esteem for all items.  

```{r reverse}
sses_raw <- bind_rows(sses_pre_raw, sses_post_raw)
reverse_questions <- c('q2', 'q4', 'q5', 'q7', 'q8', 'q10', 'q13', 'q15', 'q16', 'q17', 'q18', 'q19', 'q20')

sses_rev <- sses_raw
sses_rev[,reverse_questions] <- 4 - sses_raw[,reverse_questions]
```

**Explanation of commands:**

1. Because the remaining preprocessing applies to both pre- and post- data, we join them together using `sses_raw <- bind_rows(sses_pre_raw, sses_post_raw)`.

1. We set `reverse_questions` to be a vector of the column names of the SSES items that are reverse scored.

1. `4 - sses_raw[,reverse_questions]` reverses the scores for the reversed items. There's a lot going on here, so we'll explain each part of the command:

    1. The values inside the square brackets of `sses_raw[,reverse_questions]` select a subset of rows and columns from `sses_raw`. The first argument after `[` specifies which rows to select. Leaving this empty, means 'all rows'. The argument after the `,` specifies which columns to select. We specified colums to be the reversed item column names that we defined in `reverse_questions`.
    1. Having selected just the rows and columns containing values we neeed to reverse score,  `4 - ` applies a vectorised subtraction to subtract each value on the right-hand side of the `-` from `4`, thereby reversing the score. This is similar to the vectorised addition we used above. So if a reversed score was `4` (the maximum on the Likert scale), this command would convert it to `0` (`4 - 4`). The same applies to any other value on the scale.
    1. We assign the results of the subtractions back to the same subset of rows and columns with `sses_rev[,reverse_questions] <-` 

Now that our items are all scored in the same direction, we can calculate the SSES scores using the same technique we used for [calculating subscale scores](#subscales):

```{r pre-score, R.options = list(width = 100)}
sses_raw <- mutate(sses_raw, total = rowSums(sses_raw[4:23]))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
sses_raw %>% head(3) %>% pander(split.table = Inf)
```
