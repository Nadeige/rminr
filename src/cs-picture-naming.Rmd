# Introduction

This study was an experiment which evaluated Words in Game (WinG) test, a tool for assessing children’s language development. WinG consists of a set of picture cards which are used in four tests: noun comprehension, noun production, predicate comprehension, and predicate production. The Italian and English versions of the WinG cards use different pictures to depict the associated words. The experiment tested whether English-speaking children produce similar responses for the two sets of cards. This was a 4 (test) x 2 (cards) mixed design.

The data for each test was recorded on a sub-sheet of an Excel spreadsheet. There was also a sub-sheet containing demographic data.

# Getting started

To prepare for this worksheet, follow these steps:

1. Open the project you used to complete the [Better scales](better-scales.html) worksheet.

<a name="preprocessing"></a>

# Preprocessing

See also: [Better tables](#better-tables.html)

We summarise the preprocessing steps here. They explained in full in the [Better tables](#better-tables.html) worksheet.

We start by reading the data from `picture-naming.xlsx` and preprocessing the demographics sub-sheet. This includes scores for the Communicative Development Inventory (CDI). The CDI is a list of 100 words with columns 'understands' and 'says'. For each word, parents place a tick in these columns if they think their child can understand and/or say the word. The scores for 'understands' (`cdi_u`) and 'says' (`cdi_s`) is a total of the ticked boxes in the two columns.

```{r demographics, message=FALSE}
rm(list = ls()) # clear the environment
library(tidyverse)
library(pander)

# read data
library(readxl)
path <- 'going-further/picture-naming.xlsx'
data <- path %>%
  excel_sheets() %>%
  .[-1] %>%
  set_names() %>%
  map_df(~ read_excel(path = path, sheet = .x, range = "A1:V20"), .id = "sheet")

# demographics data
demographics <- data %>%
  filter(sheet == 'Demographic') %>%
  set_names(~ str_to_lower(.)) %>%
  select(gender, cdi_u, cdi_s) %>%
  mutate(gender = factor(gender), subj = factor(seq.int(nrow(.))))
demographics$gender <- recode_factor(demographics$gender, Male = 'male', Female = 'female')
demographics %>% head(3) %>% pander()
```

Next we preprocess the WinG data. When the experimenters administer WinG, they use a textual coding scheme to record each child's responses. The codes we'll use for the analyses in this worksheet are:

* `N/A` (not to be confused with the `R` data type `NA`) - researchers use this code to indicate that there was some kind of interruption to the task (e.g. the child began crying).
* `C` or `C*` - `C` indicates that the child responded correctly for the picture on the card, `C*` indicates that the response was a correct synonym. In this experiment, both of these values are considered correct responses.

The `exclude()` function applies the following exclusion criteria to our data:

1. Any subject 'N/A' for one of the first 17 words in a task. This criterion excludes children with insufficient data for analysis for a task.
1. Any subject in the remaining data whose accuracy was less than two standard deviations below the mean. This is a more general criterion to exlude subjects who had especially low scores for various reasons.

`exclude()` also calculates the total score for each WinG task (noun and predicate comprehension and production).

```{r WinG}
# task data
nc <- data %>%
  filter(sheet == 'Noun Comprehension') %>%
  set_names(~ str_to_lower(.)) %>%
  select(mountain:wellyboots, cards) %>%
  mutate(subj = factor(seq.int(nrow(.))))
nc %>% head(3) %>% pander(split.table = Inf)

cards <- nc %>%
  select(subj, cards) %>%
  mutate(cards = recode_factor(.$cards, `1` = 'italian', `2` = 'english'))
cards %>% pander()

# apply exclusion criteria to sub-test data
exclude <- function(df) {
  # exclude if N/A in item 17 or lower
  logical_matrix <- df == 'N/A'
  q17 <- logical_matrix %>%
    which(arr.ind = TRUE) %>%
    data.frame() %>%
    group_by(row) %>%
    summarise(min = min(col)) %>%
    mutate(subj = factor(row)) %>%
    select(subj, min)
  q17 <- left_join(df, q17, by='subj') %>%
    replace_na(list(min = 20))
  q17 <- q17 %>% filter(min > 17) %>% select(-min)
  
  # calculate total correct
  q17 <- q17 %>% mutate(correct = rowSums(. == 'C' | . == 'C*'))
  
  # exclude participants with scores < 2 sd below the mean
  q17 %>% filter(correct < mean(correct) + 2 * sd(correct))
}

nc <- exclude(nc)
nc_by_subj <- select(nc, subj, correct)
nc_by_subj %>% pander()

np <- data %>%
  filter(sheet == 'Noun Production') %>%
  set_names(~ str_to_lower(.)) %>%
  select(beach:gloves) %>%
  mutate(subj = factor(seq.int(nrow(.))))

np <- exclude(np)
np_by_subj <- np %>% select(subj, correct)

pc <- data %>%
  filter(sheet == 'Predicate Comprehension') %>%
  set_names(~ str_to_lower(.)) %>%
  select(big:pulling) %>%
  mutate(subj = factor(seq.int(nrow(.))))
pc <- exclude(pc)

pc_by_subj <- pc %>% select(subj, correct)

pp <- data %>%
  filter(sheet == 'Predicate Production') %>%
  set_names(~ str_to_lower(.)) %>%
  select(small:pushing) %>%
  mutate(subj = factor(seq.int(nrow(.))))
pp <- exclude(pp)

pp_by_subj <- pp %>% select(subj, correct)

# join data
task_by_subj <- left_join(demographics, nc_by_subj, by='subj') %>%
  left_join(., np_by_subj, by='subj', suffix = c('_nc','_np')) %>%
  left_join(., pc_by_subj, by='subj') %>%
  left_join(., pp_by_subj, by='subj', suffix = c('_pc', '_pp')) %>%
  left_join(., cards, by='subj') %>%
  mutate(nc = correct_nc, np = correct_np, pc = correct_pc, pp = correct_pp) %>%
  select(subj, gender, nc, np, pc, pp, cards, cdi_u, cdi_s)
```

Our preprocessed data has a subject number (`subj`), the child's `gender`, their WinG scores (or `NA` if they were excluded from one of the tests, `nc`, `np`, `pc`, `pp`), the `cards` they were tested with, and their parents' CDI 'understands' (`cdi_u`) and 'says' (`cdi_s`) ratings.

# Results

## CDI: Bayesian t-tests _without_ exlusions



* NOTE: Their t(22) is becuause 6 @ 24m + 16 @ 30m = 22

"A t-test confirmed that there were no significant differences between the
two groups in the scores for the CDI ‘understands’ (Italian card group M=53.08, SD=
26.47, English card group M=58.33, SD= 21.36), t(22)= -.535, p= .598."

```{r cdi-understands}
```

" there were no significant differences between the scores for the
two groups for the CDI ‘says’ (Italian card group M=40.5, SD=24.76, English card
group M=44.75, SD= 23.96), t(22)= -.427, p= .673. Demonstrating that the two
groups are of similar abilities and so any differences we find will be due to the
differences between the two sets of WinG cards rather than differing abilities
between the groups."

# Table of Independent t-test data comparing performance between genders

C means correct, C* means correct synonym. These are combined to form correct total.

* "The number of correct responses for the English cards (mean rank
= 15.04) and the Italian cards (mean rank = 9.96) were not statistically significantly
different, U = 41.5, z = 1.779, p = .078, using an exact sampling distribution for U
(Dineen & Blakesley, 1973)."

* "The number of correct responses for the English cards (mean rank = 13.08) and the
Italian cards (mean rank = 11.92) were not statistically significantly different, U = 65,
z = .406, p = .713,"

* Plot mean correct response ~ PC/PP * E/I with CI bars

C+C* ~ PC/PP * E/I

* "The number of correct responses for the English cards (mean rank =7.95) and the Italian cards (mean rank = 11.44) were not statistically significantly different, U = 24.5, z = -1.398,
p = .173"

* "The number of correct responses for the English cards (mean rank = 9.20) and the Italian cards (mean rank = 9.88) were not statistically significantly different, U = 37, z = -.269, p = .829"

# Non-target but semantically related errors

NTS means non-target but semantically related e.g. the card was "house" but they said "hut".

NTS ~ Production(NP/PP) * Card Language(E/I)

* Plot mean semantically related responses (NTS) ~ NNTS/PNTS * E/I with CI bars

TODO: Allegra says mean rank (order lowest->highest take middle value) is best way to report Mann Whitney descriptives. This looks the same as the median. Check if there's a difference.

* "A Mann-Whitney-U test was run to determine if there were any statistically
significant differences in the number of non-target but semantically related errors
elicited by the English WinG cards and the Italian WinG cards in the noun production
sub-test. ... The number of non-target but semantically related errors was not statistically significantly different between the English cards (Mdn = 3) and the Italian cards (Mdn = 3), U = 65, z = .415, p = .713"

* "A Mann-Whitney-U test was run to determine if there were differences in the
number of non-target but semantically related errors elicited by the English WinG
cards and the Italian WinG cards in the predicate production sub-test. Distributions of
the scores for the English cards and the Italian cards were not similar, as assessed
by visual inspection. The number of correct responses for the English cards (mean
rank = 8.60) and the Italian cards (mean rank = 10.62) were not statistically
significantly different, U = 31, z = -.821, p = .460"

# Individual cards

"As Study One found differences in the ratings of individual cards an
independent samples t-test was then conducted on the data from Study Two to
determine whether there were any significant differences between individual cards in
the two sets of WinG cards. The data was coded so that it could be analysed, correct
answers were coded as ‘1’ and incorrect answers were coded as ‘0’, (tables with all
results from the t-test can be found in the appendices)."

"For one card it was not possible to conduct a t-test because the standard deviations of both groups were 0, this was for the card Apple."
