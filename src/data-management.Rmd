## Data management best practices

* Share your data as CSV files, because it's an open data format.
* For columns which are factors, use strings rather than numbers for the factor levels, because this makes it clear what the factor levels mean.
* Where possible, use lower case column names and factor levels.
* Include a "code book" which explains what each of the columns in a data files means. See [The Perruchet Effect worksheet](#awdiss.html) for an example.
* The data you make available should be the data you collected _before_ you applied any exclusion criteria. Ideally, the exclusion criteria should be written in `R`. See [The Perruchet Effect worksheet](#awdiss.html) for an example.
* _Do_ exclude any sensitive data before sharing your data files. Be very careful with this step, as online repositories may keep track of an earlier version that you uploaded before the sensitive information was removed. It may be hard or impossible to delete these.
