# summary statistics
nc_include <- nc_include %>% mutate(rank = rank(correct))
nc_summary <- nc_include %>%
  group_by(cards) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            median = median(correct),

**Explanation of commands:**

1. `task_by_subj %>% filter(task == 'nc')` selects rows containing data for the noun comprehension task.
1. In the preprocessed data, subjects whose data was excluded for a task have the value `NA` in the `correct` column. We exclude these rows using `drop_na()`.
1. We rank the scores in both groups using `rank(correct)` and put the rankings in `rank` using `mutate()`.
1. Finally, we group the data by `cards`, and use `summarise`, to calculate the number of children in each group `n()`, the `median()` score, `mean(rank)` and `sum(rank)`.
