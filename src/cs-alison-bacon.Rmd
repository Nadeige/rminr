## Before you start

This is an advanced worksheet, which assumes you have completed the [Absolute Beginners' Guide to R](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/#beginners) course, the [Research Methods in Practice (Quantitative section)](https://benwhalley.github.io/rmip/overview-quantitative.html) course, and the [Intermediate Guide to R](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/#rmip) course.

## Introduction

This worksheet describes a full analysis pipeline for an undergraduate student dissertation which explored relationships between Polish (n=93) and British (n=104) people's emotional intelligence, religious orientation and spirituality.

In this study, emotional intelligence (EI) was treated as a trait; a personality factor relating to various aspects of emotions. Religious orientation (RO) was treated as either intrinsic or extrinsic. People who are intrinsically religious treat religion as a spiritual end in and of itself. Those who are extrinsically religious practise religion for self-serving reasons, such as social status. Spirituality was measured in terms of connectedness and its link to happiness. 

The researchers sought to replicate previous research which found that intrinsically religious people were more spiritual than extrinsically religiously people. They also predicted a negative correlation between EI and extrinsic RO. Finally, they predicted that intrinsic RO would correlate with trait EI.

## Loading data

Open the `rminr-data` project we used [previously](preproc.html#load).

Ensure you have the latest files by asking git to "`pull`" the repository. Select the `Git` tab, which is located in the row of tabs which includes the `Environment` tab. Click the `Pull` button with a downward pointing arrow. A window will open showing the files which have been pulled from the repository. Close the `Git pull` window. The `case-studies` folder should contain the folder `alison-bacon`.

Next, create a new, empty R script and save it in the `rminr-data` folder as `cs-alison-bacon.R`. Put all the commands from this worksheet into this file, and run them from there. Save your script regularly.

We start by loading the data.

```{r excel, message=FALSE}
rm(list = ls()) # clear the environment
library(tidyverse)

# read data
raw_data <- read_csv('case-studies/alison-bacon/raw_data.csv')
```

Demographic variables were controlled for in this study were age, gender,
marital status, education and religious affiliation.

QUESTION: How were marital status, education and relgious belief re-coded?

```{r prepreproc}
# marital status: 1 = married, 2 = unmarried; but range = 1-6
# marital_status = recode(.$marital_status, `1` = 'yes', `2` = 'no'))
# education: (1 for no high school education, 2 for high school education, 3 for undergraduate level, 4 for postgraduate level); but range = 1-10
# religious belief (1 for religious and 2 for nonreligious); but range = 0-8
data <- raw_data %>%
   mutate(gender = recode(.$gender, `1` = 'male', `2` = 'female'))
```

**Explanation of commands:**

We clear the workspace, load the `tidyverse` package, then read the data.

## Preprocessing

197 participants (93 polish, 104 british) were analysed (exclusions: 10 missing data, 2 no consent) Polish/English.

### Demographics

### Trait Emotional Intelligence

The Short Form Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue-SF, Petrides & Furnham, 2006), is a 30-item questionnaire, with items scored from 1-7. It consists of four factors: well-being, self-control, emotionality and sociability.

"The data obtained from TEIQue-SF was analysed through courtesy of psychometriclab.com"

QUESTION: How to score scale
QUESTION: Which items (if any) need to be reversed.

### Religions orientation

The amended Religious Orientation Scale (ROS; Maltby & Lewis, 1996), is a 20-item scale, with items scored from 1-3.

QUESTION: How to score scale
QUESTION: Which items (if any) need to be reversed.

### Spirituality

QUESTION: How to score scale
QUESTION: These are scored 1-7 in the data.
QUESTION: Which items (if any) need to be reversed.

The Spiritual Connection Questionnaire (SCQ-48; Wheeler and Hyland, 2008) is a 48-item scale, with items scored from -3 (unlike me) to +3 (like me). It has five factors: connection with nature, connection with places, connection with the universe, connection with other people, and the extent to which spirituality brings one happiness. 

The total score could be obtained by summing up scores for all the items, after reversing score for negative items (used to avoid acquiescence bias), which comprised half of the statements (24 items)."

## Correlational analysis

* t-test: intrinsic_ro ~ nationality
* t-test: extrinsic_ro ~ nationality
* t-test: ei ~ nationality
* t-test: spirituality ~ nationality

QUESTION: Which of the following correlations? Individual, or as a matrix?

"In both samples married status correlated with intrinsic orientation, but not with extrinsic
orientation. Moreover, in both samples level of education positively correlated with
trait EI. Age correlated with measures of intrinsic religious orientation and spirituality
in the British sample, but not in Polish (Intrinsic RO r = .25, p < .01, Spirituality r = .22, p < .05). Religious belief correlated with intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientations in both Polish (Intrinsic RO r = .52, p < .01, Extrinsic RO r = .57, p < .01) and British (Intrinsic RO r = .52, p < .01, Extrinsic RO r = .63, p < .01) samples. Interestingly religiousness of British participants, but not the Polish, correlated with total score of spirituality (r = .22, p < .05) suggesting that religious belief of Polish participants does not necessarily coincide with higher sense of spirituality. Moreover, several variables correlated with the main variables, contrary to what Liu (2010) found."

## Correlation matrices (Tables 1 & 2)

* Polish: Religious Belief, Intrinsic RO, Extrinsic RO, EI, Spirituality
* British: Religious Belief, Intrinsic RO, Extrinsic RO, EI, Spirituality

## Regression

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(BayesFactor)
data(attitude)

## Classical regression
summary(fm1 <- lm(rating ~ ., data = attitude))

## Compute Bayes factors for all regression models
output = regressionBF(rating ~ ., data = attitude, progress=FALSE)
output

## Best model is 'complaints' only

## Compute all Bayes factors against the full model, and
## look again at best models
head(output / output[63])

# I think equivalent BF to p value is the full.model / model.without.predictor

# complaints
output[63] / output[62]
# privileges
output[63] / output[61]
# learning
output[63] / output[60]

# m1 <- lmBF(rating ~ complaints, data = attitude)
# m2 <- lmBF(rating ~ privileges, data = attitude)
# all <- c(m1, m2)
# all
```
"The anovaBF and regressionBF functions are convenience functions designed to test several hypotheses of a particular type at once. Neither function allows the mixing of continuous and categorical covariates. If it is desired to test a model including both kinds of covariates, lmBF function must be used."


* QUESTION: Which research question does this relate to?
* QUESTION: total EI in model 2?

* Regresion table of predictors (standardised Beta, t, p/BF) + adjusted R-squared, by nationality, by model

## EI

1. EI ~ age + gender + marital_status + education + religious_belief
1. EI ~ age + gender + marital_status + education + religious_belief + happiness + universe + others + nature + places
1. EI ~ age + gender + marital_status + education + religious_belief + happiness + universe + others + nature + places + ro_i + ro_e

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ei1 <- lmBF(ei ~ age + gender + marital_status + education + religious_belief, data = foo)
ei1

## RO_i

2. ro_i ~ age + gender + marital_status + education + religious_belief
2. ro_i ~ age + gender + marital_status + education + religious_belief + happiness + universe + others + nature + places
2. ro_i ~ age + gender + marital_status + education + religious_belief + happiness + universe + others + nature + places + wellbeing + self_control + emotionality + sociability + ro_e
