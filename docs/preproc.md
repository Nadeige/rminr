# Data preprocessing

Work in progress, here's the plan:

- Load a CSV outline file from an OpenSesame experiment with just a within-subject factor, no between-subject factors (provided, single participant). 

- Select relevant columns (`select`). 

- Rename columns (`colnames`). 

- Produce a summary, e.g. of overall accuracy (`summarise`)

- Demonstrate development of script that loads in 25 files and makes one big
data frame.

- Produce a subject-level summary e.g. of each person's accuracy (`group_by`, `summarise`)

- Create a density plot. Calculate mean and standard deviation (this last part is revision of Absolute Beginners').
