## Absolute Beginners' Guide to R
_Initial workshops, run right at the beginning of Stage 1._

* [Introduction to RStudio](intro-rstudio.html). How to install RStudio, and a basic introduction to the software.

* [Exploring data](exploring-incomes.html). Means, medians, and histograms. **Assessed lab book activity**.

* [Group differences](group-differences.html). Means and standard deviations, by group. Filtering data. Effect size.

* [Evidence](evidence.html). Introduction to p values. Traditional between-subjects t-test. Bayesian between-subjects t-test.

* [Using RStudio projects](using-projects.html). Creating a new project. Using an R script. Analysing your own data. Needed for **poster assessment**.

* [Entering data by hand](entering-data-by-hand.html). Entering data into a spreadsheet. Saving data into your RStudio project.

* [Cheat sheet](cheat-sheet.html). Everything we've covered so far, condensed. _Use this for reference once you've finished the module._

* [Reasons to use R](why-r-student.html). Why this course uses R to analyse data.

## Putting R to work
_Experiential learning activities, later in Semester 1 of Stage 1_

These are mainly further practice in the skills you learned in _Absolute Beginners'_. Where the exercises contain completely new skills, these are shown in **bold**. Where the excercises extend a skill you've already been taught, these are shown in _italics_.

* [Face recognition experiment](face-recog.html). Means, _filtering data_, and a **bar graph**.

* [Response compatibility experiment](response-compatibility.html). Means, standard deviations, and density plots.
