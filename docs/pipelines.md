# Dissertation pipelines in R

## Concept

R-capable Ph.D. student (or similar) interviews a member of staff about their analysis process (from raw data to summaries and 
statistical inferences) for a current or recent UG dissertation project. Student then converts that process to an R script,
and documents how the script works by creatinig a worksheet on the RMINR website. Student meets staff member again to review
worksheet for accuracy and clarity. This process is repeated for all members of staff expected to supervise a dissertation in 
2020/21 (R-confident staff could alternatively write the worksheet themselves, but this needs knowledge of R, git, and rmarkdown).

## Benefits

1. Helps staff develop R skills, leading to more productive interactions with our now R-trained UGs, and enhanced 
research skills for staff.

2. Worksheets could also feed in to development of Stage 4 RM workshops.

3. Relieves current bottleneck of all the student-facing R materials in the School being written predominately by
two members of staff (Whalley, Wills). 

4. Publicly available resource benefitting the wider community and reinforcing our reputation as a School that takes open 
sicence seriously.

## Costings

35 staff members. 2 hours of meetings plus 8 hours of development time per staff member = 350 hours of Ph.D. student time.
If paid at demonstrator rate ~ Â£6500
