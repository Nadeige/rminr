# Two-factor ANOVA

Work in progress, here's the plan:

1. Introduces the concept of an interaction as a difference of differences. Spends
a bunch of time explaning this from as many angles as possible (including
graphical), because a lot of students find this really hard. Probably give some
examples from the published literature.

2. Students work through several examples of real data plotted and tabled in
various forms, with a potted explanation of the study, and are asked to record
in Psyc:EL whether (numerically) they show a clear interaction or not, and what the
interpretation is of these data in terms of the experiment run. 

3. Goes through a few examples of two-factor ANOVA with real data in
R, showing both NHST and Bayes  versions.
