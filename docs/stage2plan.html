<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Group structure</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Students work in sub-groups of 5-6 students. Each teacher is the mentor for
three sub-groups (total: 18 students) and follows them throughout the
semester. There's one group leader for every four teachers. The group leader
does not have an allocated group of students but is responsible for the overall
smooth running of the 12 sub-groups.
</p>

<p>
1 group leader
</p>

<p>
4 teachers
</p>

<p>
72 students
</p>

<p>
We then have as many of these Groups as we need to meet cohort
size - four should be sufficient for current cohort sizes.

<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Example of topics and questions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
A topic might be 'Basic processes of learning'. Within that topic, the team
leader has indentified 2-4 sub-topics. For example:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Relationship between surprise and learning
</li>
<li>Is learning sudden or gradual?
</li>
<li>What determines whether we learn smart rules or dumb similarity?
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I've provided some example slides (learning-topics.odp). 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Data collection</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Data collection works by 5/6 of each student group participating in six
experiments. For 30min studies, this takes 3 hours plus shifting time, so
easily fills two weeks. It results in N=25 for each experiment. For reasonable
power the first data collection should therefore be a within-subject design with a
reasonable effect size. The second data collection should in some way permit
the inclusion of a b/subj effect (even if that's just a cross-experiment
comparison).

<h3 id="sec-7-1"><span class="section-number-3">7.1</span> Laptops/desktops</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-1">
<p>
I've assumed students have a laptop (PC, Mac or Linux) they will bring with
them to sessions. A phone or a tablet will not do. They need to be told this
well in advance, as laptops are needed from Week 1. The laptop doesn't have to
be particularly good, but it will need a good enough battery to last through a
2 hour session.
</p>

<p>
The Project Team will have to consider whether this requirement is reasonable
and, if not, how we provide enough desktop machines to meet the individual
assessment requirement of the DMR.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-7-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7-2"><span class="section-number-3">7.2</span> Lab book</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-2">
<p>
The proposed online lab-book system might be an effective way to deal with
weekly delivery of materials, and submission of pass/fail exercises.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-7-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7-3"><span class="section-number-3">7.3</span> R server</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-3">
<p>
One alternative to getting students to install R on their own machines is to
run Rstudio on a server, with all packages needed pre-installed. Students then
only need a web browser to use R. The software for doing this is free and open
source, so we could either host it ourselves, or pay some company to host it
for us. 
</p>

<p>
The is no equivalent for PsychoPy - that would have to be locally installed.

<h2 id="sec-8"><span class="section-number-2">8</span> Pass/fail assessment</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
The Methods sesssions have 1-2 pass/fail components per session, assessed by
the Teachers, during the class. We set some pass proportion (e.g. you have to
get 80% pass marks recorded to pass the class). There are catch-up sessions in
the main schedule of work that allow students who were absent (or who failed)
to pass these exercises at a later date.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-1-1">
<p>
0 min - Each Team Leader has already recorded a 15 min video presentation of a
topic area they have selected (probably related to their research
expertise). The Group views the videos from the other Team Leaders, and then
the Team Leader gives their own 15 minute presentation in person.
</p>

<p>
60 min - The students get a 20 minute 'break', during which time they can
discuss the topics with each other and with the Teachers and Team Leaders.
</p>

<p>
80 min - The students select a topic by going to stand at a particular point in
the room. The Team Leader allocates Teachers to topics commensurate with their
popularity (e.g. if half the students pick topic A, then half the Teachers are
allocated to Topic A). 
</p>

<p>
85 min - Students are told to self-organize into sub-groups of between 5-7
members. Each group is going to select a question within the topic to study for
the next 11 weeks, so it makes sense to group on similar interests and
friendship. Teachers self-organize one to each sub-group
</p>

<p>
90 min - Teachers do introductions for their sub-group, and then talk to them
about each of the 2-4 sub-topics in this topic area. Students are given
questions and assigned reading.
</p>

<p>
105 min - Students are told the homework: 
</p>

<p>
(1) For session 1B: Follow DLE instructions to install R, Rstudio, and PsychoPy
on their personal laptops.
</p>

<p>
(2) For session 2A: Read the assigned papers, 
</p>

<p>
(3) For session 2A: Decide in your group which topic you are going to
invesitgate
</p>

<p>
110 min - Finish.

<p>
Materials: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A basic-as-possible PsychoPy script in a ZIP archive that implements a
short conjunctive visual search experiment with two set sizes.
</li>

<li>A basic-as-possible R script to produce a correct present/absent RT by set
size (5, 20) graph from an individual's data. Use tidyverse. 
</li>
</ol>

<p>
0 min - Team leader gives a 20 min presentation on basics of PsychoPy from a
user perspective i.e.: Download and install (for anyone who didn't do this
homework). Initial becnhmarking. Zipping and unzipping. Loading a
script. Running it. Entering subject number. Locating the 3 data files (csv,
log, psydat). Keeping a backup. Inspecting the CSV file - rows are trials,
columns are info. Calculating a result from a CSV file by hand.
</p>

<p>
20 min - Short period while students and teachers get into subgroups and anyone
who was absent in session 1 is matched up with groups that have fewer than 7
members.
</p>

<p>
25 min - Students individually go through the demonstrated steps, using a ZIP
archive downloaded from DLE. Teachers keep records of who has done this
successfully and hence has a pass mark for this exercise (this could possibly
be done through the online lab book). 
</p>

<p>
55 min - Break
</p>

<p>
65 min - Team leader gives 20 min presentation on basics of data processing in
R. This is revision from Stage 1. Download and install R and Rstudio. Describe
the four-panel interface of R. Show how to: (1) Load a CSV file, (2) Select the
relevant columns, (3) Give those columns nice names, (4) aggregate the
trial-level data into a subject-level summary. (5) Plot a simple graph.
</p>

<p>
85 min - Students individually go through the demonstrated seteps, using a ZIP
archive downloaded from DLE. Teachers record passes (perhaps via online lab
book system). 
</p>

<p>
105 min - Students are reminded of homework from Session A, and encouraged to
play around with R and Psychopy before next week. Also, the following
additional homework is set:
</p>

<p>
(4) Send the three files from your run of the PsychoPy experiment to your team
leader by email (this again could be done via online labbook instead if such a
system were avaialble). This is also a recorded-pass exercise.

10 min - Students discuss with each other, and their Teacher, what they have
read and brainstorm on possible questions one might ask about this topic.
</p>

<p>
40 min - Team leader gives 20 min presentation on how to get from a sub-topic to
an broad experimental design (1st half of exp-design slides)
</p>

<p>
60 min - With support from Teachers, sub-groups select a question and plan a
broad experimental design.

<p>
100 min - The sub-group nominates a student scribe to write down their idea in
no more than one page of A4 and email to their teacher and every member of
their sub-group (alternative: lab book).
</p>

<p>
105 min - Team leader sets homework:

1B experiment (these were collected in Week 1 from students). Runs R script from
week 1 on a few of them to demonstrate variability in psychological
data. Demonstrate development of that script which loads in all 200 files,
makes one big data frame. 
</p>

<p>
20 min - Get into sub-groups

<p>
30 min - Pass/fail assessed individual exercise replicating the steps in the
team leader presentation.

<p>
60 min - Team leader presents on taking differences at a subject-level as a
good way of getting a better signal. Ignores present/absent, focusses on set
size. Demonstrates R script to take differences and plot histogram thereof. Use
this to revise concepts of mean and variance. Demonstrate mean and variance
calculation in R.

0 min - Team Leader reminds Group brief of material covered in 2B. Goes from
those ideas of mean and variance to the ideas of expeirmental and null
hypotheses, the idea of inferential testing, and the idea of a within-subjects
t-test. Demonstrates how to get from the 200 subject data set of 2B to a p
value using R. Discusses how t-test assesses P(data|null).

60 min - Team Leader presentation on how P(data|null) is what we traditionally
calculate but almost never what we actually want to know. Generally, we want to
know whether the experimental or null is more likely, given our data. So,
P(exp|data) / P(null|data). This is different, and not related to a p-value in
any simple way. Fortuantely, it's also possible to calculate that ratio (a
Bayes Factor). Demonstrate how to do this using Morey's BayesFactor package
(Note: I'm a bit sad that this is a non-informative-prior approach to Bayes,
but one step at a time&#x2026;)

0 min - In a pretty theory-light manner, TL introduces within/subj ANOVA as an
alternative method for doing  what we did with a within/subj
t-test. Demonstrates how to do this with same dataset as 5B, using 'ez' package
in R. Explain an F-ratio as conceptually a similar thing to a t-value i.e. a
ratio of the size of the difference to the size of the variability. Shows how
to pick out the figures needed for a standard report of e.g. F(1, 243) = 2.12,
p &lt; .001. Then, explain why we'd bother with something that's so similar to a
t-test - two reasons: (1) To have more than two nominal levels (covered this
session), (2) to look at more than one factor at the same time (covered in a
later session). Then, demonstrate one-factor w/subj ANOVA with a different
large dataset with 3 nominal levels, again using 'ez' package'.

have a significant result when there are more than two nominal levels in the
factor. Demonstrate use of subsetting and a t-test to look at a specific pair
in the 6B data set. Discuss the rapdily increasing number of pairs in a set of
items, and the problem of multiple comparisons. Introduce Bonferroni as simple
(but conservative way to deal with this). Show how to do Bonferroni in R.

assumed knowledge; over-crowded slides; a million facts but no big picture; a
big picture but no facts; conclusions do not cleary follow from facts.

differences. They should really spend a bunch of time explaning this from as
many angles as possible (including graphical), because a lot of students find
this really hard. Probably give some examples from the published literature. 
</p>

20 min - Students work through 8-10 examples of real data plotted and tabled in
various forms, with a potted explanation of the study, and are asked to write
down whether (numerically) they show a clear interaction or not, and what the
interpretation is of these data in terms of the experiment run. Teachers go
around and discuss/check a randomly selected answer with each student. If the
student gets it wrong, the teacher explains the correct answer and asks them to
do another example, which they'll come back to. Getting one right by the end of
this session counts as a pass.

<p>
The sub-group and Teacher reflect on their results, and the feedback received
on their presentation. They discuss what they would have done differently if
they were starting again. They make an assessment of how serious these
shortcomings are to drive the following decision. Should they:
</p>

<p>
(A) Run a modified version of their first experiment, mainly centered on
addressing the shortcomings of their design or results (e.g. ceiling/floor
effects).
</p>

<p>
(B) Add a between-subjects condition to their existing study that widens the
investigation to add another factor. Run that second condition in their second
data colleciton phase. 
</p>

<p>
If choosing B, the Teacher needs to clarify that adding a condition like this
is OK for teaching purposes but should  be avoided in research you're going
to publish. It introduces a time-of-testing confound. Between-subject
conditions should be finely intermixed. 
</p>

<p>
By the beginning of Session 10A, the group should have an agreed protocol for the
next data collection phase. Again a scribe should be nominated (a 5th different
