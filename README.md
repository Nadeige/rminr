## Welcome to Research Methods in R

### Notes to developers

The files in the _docs_ directory are the live contents of the RMINR website. The files are a mix of .md and .html. If you change the .md files, the live contents of the site changes. 

The .html files are knitted from the .Rmd files in the _src_ directory. Do not change the .html files directly. Instead, change the .Rmd files, knit them and copy the resulting .html file into the _docs_ directory.
